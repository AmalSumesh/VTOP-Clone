# VTOP-Clone
The project title is "Clone of VTOP Landing Page".
This static website made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) only is a clone of the landing page of VTOP(https://vtop.vit.ac.in/vtop/open/page), which is a digital initiative by the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) that allows students, faculty, staff, parents, and alumni to access and process academics, research, and supporting services.
