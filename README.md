# VTOP-Clone
This is my first Git Repository.
Project Title - Clone of VTOP Landing Page.
Programming Languages used - HTML & CSS.
This static website made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) only is a clone of the landing page of VTOP, which is a digital initiative by the Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) that allows students, faculty, staff, parents, and alumni to access and process academics, research, and supporting services.
